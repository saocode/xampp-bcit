RDP Wiki Embed lets you embed content from MediaWiki sites.

== Description ==

RDP Wiki Embed will pull content from any MediaWiki website (such as wikipedia.org) and embed it in pages and posts. It strips and reformats the content, allowing you to supply some arguments to dictate how this works.

RDP Wiki Embed can also look for all links to wiki sites listed in the Security section and force the content on the current page to be replaced with the content found at the wiki site when the link is clicked. Visitors will be able to read wiki content without leaving your site.

Works automatically with [RDP PediaPress Embed] (https://wordpress.org/plugins/rdp-pediapress-embed/)

* infobox_show: 0 (zero) to hide info boxes or 1 to show 
* unreferenced_show: 0 (zero) to hide "unreferenced" warning boxes  or 1 to show 
* wiki_update: number of minutes content of the wiki page will be stored on your site, before it is refreshed 
* wiki_links: behavior after clicking a link to wiki content - **default** or **overwrite**
* wiki_links_open_new: 0 (zero) to open wiki links in same window or 1 to open in new window 
* global_content_replace: 1 to apply embed overwrite behavior to all wiki links on the site or 0 (zero)
